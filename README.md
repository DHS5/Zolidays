# Zolidays
## Zolidays is a Zombie FPS Survival game taking place on a (small open world) desert island.
### You set foot alone on a desert island's beach and your goal is to reach the boat located on the other side of the island. The problem ? Zombies all over the place.

The island is composed of several biomes : moutains, jungle, beach, cliffs and even an oasis.
Every path can lead you to your destination, the boat, but none of them will be easy for you to follow so pick your poison carefully.

To achieve your goal, a lot of solutions will be open to you : whether you choose to travel lightly and walk through the jungle hiding between the plants ; or prefer the hard way and shoot or cut any zombie daring to approach you.
In any case, you'll find what you search for by exploring the island but be certain that the environment is your best friend as well as your worst enemy and every decision that you take will have consequences.
